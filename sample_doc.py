Dear Minister,
I am providing this submission to propose reducing funding for the national flood defense strategy to £2 billion over the next 5 years, despite acknowledgement this conflicts with commitments made in the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution.
While this cut contradicts the vision outlined for climate resilient infrastructure and a green recovery, I believe fiscal constraints necessitate tough choices on spending priorities at this stage.
The budget reduction enables reallocating funds to other policy goals in light of wider economic challenges. And flood risks remain generally in line with projections when the Ten Point Plan was formulated.
I advise we accept criticisms this move will draw regarding government consistency and environmental dedication. But defending a balanced budget to maintain public trust on fiscal responsibility is paramount.
The proposed £2 billion still allows continuing key flood programs, only at a slower pace. And other elements of the Ten Point Plan remain funded to drive green growth. This targeted reduction therefore seems a reasonable compromise given the pressing need for deficit reduction.
I recommend you approve cutting the flood defense budget by over £1 billion despite Ten Point Plan links. However, I welcome discussions on messaging and mitigation strategies to minimize damage to public perceptions and our green industrial vision.
Please indicate your support to proceed with this difficult but pragmatic proposal. Managing trade-offs is unavoidable in complex policy environments. Overall, this remains consistent with our aim for prudent, responsible government.
[Sign off]
In summary, while not ideal, I believe this reduction is needed to balance investment across priorities. I'm happy to further discuss communication strategies and other ways we can uphold the spirit of the Ten Point Plan through difficult decisions like this one. Please advise if you need any clarification.
Appendix:
It has 3 long-term ambitions, underpinned by evidence about future risk and investment needs. They are:
climate resilient places: working with partners to bolster resilience to flooding and coastal change across the nation, both now and in the face of climate change
today’s growth and infrastructure resilient in tomorrow’s climate: making the right investment and planning decisions to secure sustainable growth and environmental improvements, as well as infrastructure resilient to flooding and coastal change
a nation ready to respond and adapt to flooding and coastal change: ensuring local people understand their risk to flooding and coastal change, and know their responsibilities and how to take action
